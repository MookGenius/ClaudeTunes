    phases:
      - Phase A: Telemetry Core
      - Phase B: Physics Chain
      - Phase C: Constraint Evaluation
      - Phase D: Setup Sheet Output

phase_a:
  file_intake:
    - "Parse car_data (vehicle basics, current setup, ranges)"
    - "Parse telemetry JSON (suspension, yaw, steering, tire temps, inputs)"
    - "Validate essential arrays"

  required_telemetry:
    - "Wheel displacements (FL/FR/RL/RR)"
    - "Lateral G"
    - "Yaw rate"
    - "Steering/throttle/brake inputs"
    - "Tire temps (I/M/O per corner)"

  suspension_analysis:
    fft_warning: "GT7 60Hz insufficient for FFT (0.5-5Hz suspension range needs >120Hz)"
    travel_pattern_analysis:
      steps:
        - "Avg compression per corner (F vs R, L vs R)"
        - "Flag bottoming (>90% travel)"
        - "Higher compression = relatively softer"
        - "Cross-validate with balance + temps"

    # CRITICAL: Bottoming Detection Logic (v8.5.3b fix)
    bottoming_detection:
      method: "Distinguish chassis bottoming (too soft) vs suspension at travel limits (too stiff)"
      body_height_threshold: "15mm (CHASSIS_BOTTOMING_THRESHOLD)"

      chassis_bottoming:
        condition: "High suspension travel (>280mm) AND min_body_height < 15mm"
        diagnosis: "Suspension too soft - chassis hitting ground"
        action: "Increase frequency +0.15 to +0.30 Hz (stiffen)"
        telemetry_override: "POSITIVE adjustment"

      suspension_maxed:
        condition: "High suspension travel (>280mm) AND min_body_height >= 15mm"
        diagnosis: "Suspension too stiff - hitting mechanical travel limits but chassis has clearance"
        action: "Decrease frequency -0.15 to -0.30 Hz (soften)"
        telemetry_override: "NEGATIVE adjustment"

      severity_thresholds:
        moderate: ">280mm travel"
        severe: ">300mm travel"

      ride_height_rule: "Only raise ride height for CHASSIS BOTTOMING, not suspension maxed"

      key_insight: |
        Both "too soft" and "too stiff" can show high suspension travel:
        - Too soft: Suspension compresses fully, chassis hits ground (low body_height)
        - Too stiff: Suspension can't compress, hits mechanical limits (adequate body_height)
        Use min_body_height data to distinguish between these opposite problems.

    counter_intuitive_strategies:
      arb: "Stiffer rear/softer front (opposite of FR/MR) - generates rotation from understeer-prone platform"

      differential: "Braking lock > Accel lock (stabilizes pendulum effect during deceleration)"
      damping: "Rear rebound is PRIMARY control for braking stability - controls rear lift rate"
    key_insight: |
      RR platforms naturally understeer in mid/high-speed corners despite 60%+ rear weight.
      This is due to yaw moment physics, NOT grip. Professional teams exploit this by inverting
      conventional ARB logic: stiffer rear ARB forces rotation while softer front maintains compliance.

      note: "Braking lock > Accel lock - stabilizes engine mass during braking entry"
      professional_reference: "GT3 LSD: 40% accel / 60% decel lock (factory specification)"
      philosophy: "High braking sensitivity prevents rear engine mass from 'overtaking' front under braking"

version_context:
  v8_5_3a_changes:
    1: "Aero frequency adders reduced 75% (was +0.8-1.5 Hz, now +0.2-0.5 Hz max)"
    2: "Power platform control separated from aero (independent high-power adders)"
    3: "GT7 Downforce Database added (complete reference by car class)"
    4: "Ride height priority reordered (CG/geometry 80%, mechanical 15%, aero 5%)"
    5: "Aero balance simplified (use ~40% front convention, minor adjustments only)"

  v8_5_3b_changes:
    critical_fix: "Bottoming detection now distinguishes chassis bottoming vs suspension at travel limits"
    before: "High travel always diagnosed as 'bottoming' → recommended stiffer springs (wrong for stiff setups)"
    after: "Uses min_body_height to determine if chassis hitting ground (too soft) or suspension maxed (too stiff)"
    impact: "Prevents making overly-stiff race car setups even stiffer"
    test_case: "BMW M3 GT at Laguna Seca - correctly diagnosed as too stiff, recommended -0.30 Hz (23% softer)"

  # 🏁 NEW IN v8.5.3RR
  v8_5_3RR_changes:
    purpose: "Enhanced for RR (rear-engine) platforms based on professional Porsche GT3/Cup methodologies"
    research_basis: "docs/Porsche setup_Reference.md - OptimumG theory + factory race team practices"
    includes_v8_5_3b_fix: "YES - bottoming detection logic fully integrated"
    key_refinements:
      1: "Differential RR_PURE: Braking lock raised to 45-55 (was 20-40) - 'pendulum lock' strategy"
      2: "ARB RR strategy: +2R/-1F bias (inverted from conventional) - generates rotation from understeer platform"
      3: "Damping RR rule: Added rear rebound braking instability trigger (+3-5% rear rebound critical adjustment)"
      4: "Documentation: Added rr_platform_notes explaining counter-intuitive professional strategies"
      5: "Bottoming detection: Chassis vs suspension maxed logic (v8.5.3b fix included)"
    validation: |
      Professional Porsche data confirms frequency bias (+0.6 to +0.9 Hz rear) is appropriate.
      996 GT3 Cup: 240N/mm front, 260N/mm rear springs (8.3% stiffer rear).
      The refinements address the unique challenge: RR cars naturally understeer despite rear weight
      due to yaw moment physics. Professional teams exploit this via inverted ARB/damping strategies.

  rationale: "GT7 aero deliberately nerfed (~10% real-world effectiveness). Occam's validation: 1300 lbs DF = 0.115s vs 3-5s real-world."
  philosophy: "Mechanical grip optimization >> Aerodynamic tuning in GT7"
